param.xml - a parameter file to generate point correspondences for an unseen shape.
A shape model is trained on a set of shapes.
For a given unseen shape, the point files are initialized to the mean shape of the trained shape model.
The trained shape model point files are fixed (fixed domains) to generate the point correspondences for the unseen shape.
