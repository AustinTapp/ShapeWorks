### ShapeWorks Python module

This contains first draft of the shapeworks module with associated libraries and conda install scripts (meta.yaml, build.sh, bld.bat). 

DEVELOPERS: in order to use it today, first create a symlink to the compiled module inside the shapeworks directory:  
`(shapeworks) ...Python/shapeworks $ ln -s <path/to/your/build/bin/shapeworks.cpython[hit-tab] ./shapeworks`

TODO: deploy shapeworks with all the binaries inside the module (it's okay if other stuff like Studio is in there, too)

``` python
import shapeworks as sw
sw.paaaaaaaaaarrrrtaaayyyy(365, 7, 24)
```
