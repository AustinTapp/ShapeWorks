# Shapes, What & From Where?

## What is Shape?

![What is Shape?](../img/getting-started/shape.pdf)

The shape is the characteristic that remains after removing all global geometrical information from an object. To study shape, we would like to study the differences among these characteristics in populations of objects belonging to the same class.

## What is Shape Modeling?

Shape modeling is about learning population-specific parameterization.

## Where Shapes Come From? 


In medical imaging, shapes can be obtained from images of anatomies (e.g., CTs and MRIs), where anatomies of interest can be [manually or semi-automatically](#free-softwares-for-segmentation) segmented/delineated. Other applications could entail modeling geometries using computer-aided design systems, or acquiring real-world objects through sampling (2D via image acquisition devices, 3D via laser scanners).
