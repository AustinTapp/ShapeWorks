# ShapeWorks Studio Optimize Module

The Optimize module provides options for the particle-based optimization.  After selecting options and clicking "Run Optimize", you can monitor the process of the optimization in real-time.  Particle positions will be displayed on individual shapes as they progress where color encodes surface correspondences across different shapes in your cohort.
