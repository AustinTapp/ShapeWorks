Merging individual executables into shapeworks.

Notes below identify command name changes and any parameter name changes, which
have been intentionally minimized in order to facilite upgrading existing

We should also create example Python and C++ apps that show using the API
directly.

These notes also indicate duplicated functionality that has been discovered.

- AntiAliasing -> shapeworks antialias
 o ShapeWorksGroom class duplicates this functionality, has different defaults
